## Nothing Fancy

No scripts or stylesheets enqueued. No settings or admin pages. Just some basic infrustructure to be renamed then developed further.

## Compatibility

* This plugin was written on a local server running PHP 7.3
* The short array syntax ( `[]` rather than `array()` ) requires PHP 5.4+
